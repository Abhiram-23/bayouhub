Cheryl, a Louisiana native, has always loved the art of chocolate confections. She started Bittersweet Confections with a mission to create an exceptional collection of chocolates using local ingredients and superior chocolate. After sharing kitchen space for many years with other chefs and working from local outdoor Farmer’s Markets, Cheryl eventually decided to branch out by opening her doors on Magazine Street in 2004. In 2005 Hurricane Katrina devastated Chery's home and business, and Cheryl was forced to relocate with her family to Baton Rouge. Six months later she was able to return to New Orleans with her family and start to pick up the pieces. It was like a movie with no script, and new characters added daily. Bittersweet continues to be a page turner... Cheryl has grown her one person concept into a successful café and bakery with two locations, and a team of 30 amazing chefs, baristas, and cake decorators. Bittersweet serves breakfast and lunch, locally roasted coffee and espresso, fresh baked croissants, muffins, scones, breads and French inspired seasonal desserts. Bittersweet will make you a birthday cake or a wedding cake. Other accolades include,” Best King Cake” by NOLA Defenders, four years in a row, for the chocolate King Cake. Watch the annual calendar, as Cheryl is one of the Chef’s presenting at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, where she educates, entertains and shares on the joys of chocolate. Cheryl now uses her shops to celebrate the spirit and resilience of the city. She uses locally grown pecans, citrus, and dairy products to make her decadent truffles. The chocolate truffle collections are named for unique local landmarks such as Royal Street and Canal Street, or for New Orleans neighborhoods, such as the French Quarter and the Garden District. Visit her boutiques in the historic New Orleans Warehouse District. Bittersweet Confections is passionate about food and chocolate, and loves sharing our creations with you.
