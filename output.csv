Gnarly Barley Brewing Co. originated from the home of Zac and Cari Caramonta. What started in a cramped garage, surrounded by two fat cats and a halfpipe, quickly grew into a passion for crafting exceptional beers.

The Korova Milk Porter and the Hoppopotamus IPA debuted at the 2011 New Orleans on Tap Beer Festival.

Long's political life.","Below the Historic Hilton Capitol Center lies a secret tunnel that many have heard about, few have seen. The tunnel is steeped in history and played an important role during Huey P. Long‚Äôs political life. Completed in the late 20‚Äôs , the tunnel served as a connector between two hotels and allowed the opulent, full-service Heidelberg Hotel to create a similar experience for the smaller King hotel across the street including room service, valet, and laundry services.
Later, The Tunnel became known as ‚ÄúPeacock Alley‚Äù as it was adorned with ornate mosaic tiles and was also widely used by hotel guests and clientele. Huey P. Long worked and stayed in the Heidelberg throughout his career and even conducted business from his suite while under a looming impeachment from his Governorship. The media frenzy often caused the need for a quick escape, which The Tunnel provided."

Being partners in other restaurants, we also wanted to open our own concept so that we could be 100% ourselves, from our food down to the d√©cor. We have put our heart and soul into this entire place, which we consider a family restaurant because you will often see our children around or helping us out as well. We want parents to feel comfortable coming here with their families as well, as they will be welcomed by our family. In addition to our fresh authentic food, we also love the bar area that Stephanie runs. All of our margaritas are hand made with fresh ingredients, with the exception of our frozen and citrus on the rocks. We hand squeeze our lemon and lime juice, use fresh fruits, and use a high quality tequila el Jimador in all of our margaritas. We pride ourselves on the freshness of our drinks and our food. Sergio is very hands on and runs our kitchen. He also painstakingly chose each and every item for the menu making sure to be as authentic and fresh as possible. Being from Queretaro, Mexico, he has a great eye for flavor and a passion for food. We plan on adding special tacos from time to time, so be on the look out for our new ideas! We hope that everyone that comes here enjoys their visit and comes back again and again. Agave Blue is the Mexican Restaurant that has it all, and we think you will fall in love with Prairieville's best Taco & Tequila bar!"

City Cafe,citycafe113@bellsouth.net,https://citycafebr.net/,4710 O'Neal Ln,"City Cafe is a family restaurant in Baton Rouge, LA, serving classic American comfort food in a cozy and friendly atmosphere since 2002. The restaurant has a long history dating back to 1919, with original family recipes.","City Cafe has been providing good food and good service at modest prices since being established by Martin Miranda in 1919. In 1933, Martin‚Äôs brother Jimmy Miranda, wife Marie, and sister-in-law Louise began management of the restaurant, which continued for the following 43 years.

Located on Main Street in Plaquemine, next to the railroad depot where men waited for the next train, City Cafe has seen its share of history. As the men waited on their way to World War II and the Korean War, many meals were provided by Jimmy at no cost to the soldiers. In the 1930's and 1940's, City Cafe was more than a place to get good food. The downtown area of Plaquemine was a hotbed of activity. Slot machines, horse races, and poker tables provided entertainment for the patrons after a good meal.

In 1976, Jimmy and Marine sold the restaurant and it was ""out of the family"" for four years. Charles ""Squeaky"" Miranda, Jimmy and Marine's son was a Plaquemine student-athlete who went on to become a teacher and coach. While coaching at Broadmoor High School, he met Stephanie Bourgeois, a teacher at the school, and they were married. It was in 1980 that Charles decided to go back to his roots and buy back the restaurant.

His mother Marie and Aunt Louise came back to the Cafe when Charles re-opened it in 1981 after an extensive remodeling. The restaurant again became a mainstay for the locals, as well as the nearby plant workers, for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. In 1994, a fire left the restaurant in disarray, but a menu from the ""golden age"" survived. Sandwiches 25 cents, hamburger steak 60 cents, breakfast (two eggs and a homemade biscuit) 30 cents, beer 19 cents. After rebuilding, Charles, mother Marie, and Aunt Louise continued on until the Plaquemine restaurant was sold in 1998.

GRAND Re-Opening in Baton Rouge!
Charles decided to re-open City Cafe in Baton Rouge in 2002. Today, the tradition of modest prices, friendly service, and good food continues. Some of the dishes date back to the original family recipes of 1919.

We hope you enjoy the family atmosphere and tradition of City Cafe - the place ""Where Good Friends Meet."""

A friendly and welcoming spot where our neighbors could stop by to grab a frozen drink and kick back.,"We started out in 1983. Our goal was to offer a friendly and welcoming spot where our neighbors could stop by to grab a frozen drink and kick back. Little did we know we were paving the way for a frozen drink trend that would shape a category and become part of Louisiana local culture. David Briggs Jr. was the mastermind behind this phenomenon‚Äîpassing out samples on Bourbon Street, and innovating the craft with a chilling machine that made our frozen daiquiris instantly available. We brought the Big Freezy to the Big Easy, dat is. Through the 80s and 90s, we opened up new spots around the New Orleans metropolitan area and expanded to the suburbs and Baton Rouge. You‚Äôre sure to find a NOLA Original down the road or around your neighborhood. When Hurricane Katrina hit us all pretty bad back in 2005, we quickly reopened our stores to help kickstart the city's economy. It turns out New Orleans isn‚Äôt the only place that appreciates a good drink. From a few chilling machines, we‚Äôre now close to 50 locations across Louisiana."
