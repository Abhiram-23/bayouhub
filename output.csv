Gnarly Barley Brewing Co. originated from the home of Zac and Cari Caramonta. What started in a cramped garage, surrounded by two fat cats and a halfpipe, quickly grew into a passion for crafting exceptional beers.

The Korova Milk Porter and the Hoppopotamus IPA debuted at the 2011 New Orleans on Tap Beer Festival. Encouraged by positive feedback and connections made at local festivals, Zac and Cari opened a 14,000 square foot brewery in Hammond, Louisiana in 2014.."

The Tunnel,N/A,https://www.thetunnelbr.com/,201 Lafayette St,"A historic speakeasy located below the Hilton Capitol Center in Baton Rouge, LA, known for its connection to Huey P. Long's political life.","Below the Historic Hilton Capitol Center lies a secret tunnel that many have heard about, few have seen. The tunnel is steeped in history and played an important role during Huey P. Long’s political life. Completed in the late 20’s , the tunnel served as a connector between two hotels and allowed the opulent, full-service Heidelberg Hotel to create a similar experience for the smaller King hotel across the street including room service, valet, and laundry services.
Later, The Tunnel became known as “Peacock Alley” as it was adorned with ornate mosaic tiles and was also widely used by hotel guests and clientele. Huey P. Long worked and stayed in the Heidelberg throughout his career and even conducted business from his suite while under a looming impeachment from his Governorship. The media frenzy often caused the need for a quick escape, which The Tunnel provided."
